# Graph-Algorithm
Depth-first search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph by visiting as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It's often used to search for nodes or perform various graph-related tasks.

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is another graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph by visiting all the neighbors of a node before visiting their child nodes.
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that can be implemented in Python quite easily.
